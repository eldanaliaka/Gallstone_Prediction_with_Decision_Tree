# Predicting Gallstone Disease Using Decision Tree Modeling

## Project Overview
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict gallstone presence in patients based on clinical and demographic data. The workflow includes data inspection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of decision-making processes.

## Features
- Handles missing data
- Encodes categorical variables
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Trains and evaluates a Decision Tree model
- Visualizes the decision tree for interpretability

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient demographics and medical history features relevant to gallstone prediction.

## Results
- Model accuracy: XX%
- Confusion matrix, classification report, and tree visualization included in the notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Gallstone_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells
